## Web Chat

Web Chat is a full stack application that allows for real time communication between users. It is built with React, Node.js, GraphQL and WebSocket. It is a great example of how to use GraphQL subscriptions in a real world application and how to implement a WebSocket server as a Next.js API route handler. The application is also using Apollo Client and Server for GraphQL communication.
