## New Relic Snowflake integration

A New Relic integration with Snowflake to monitor query performance, logins, potential security incidents, optimise warehouse and cloud credit costs, capture any data stored in Snowflake for real-time alerting and reporting. It comes with out of the box queries to capture a good range of performance related metrics. It is easily extendible to create custom queries to capture any other metrics that are not covered by default.
