## Inversion of Control container

Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design pattern that allows for decoupling of components. It is a way of implementing dependency injection (DI) in a software application. The main goal of IoC is to reduce the amount of code that is tightly coupled to other components. This allows for easier testing and maintenance of the application.
